# TODO

- [X] Prettify Optimizer.jsx
- [ ] Fix the issue where future prediction graph is(sometimes) just displayed as flat line, not showing any variation
- [ ] Make the inputs of Optimizer.jsx more comfortable to use. (e.g. from typing 0.02 to typing 2%)
- [ ] Make portfolio optimization "somehow" faster. (machine learning?)
