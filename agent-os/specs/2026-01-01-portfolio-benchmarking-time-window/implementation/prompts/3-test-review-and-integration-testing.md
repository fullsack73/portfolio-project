We're continuing our implementation of Portfolio Benchmarking Time Window by implementing task group number 3:

## Implement this task and its sub-tasks:

#### Task Group 3: Test Review & Integration Testing
**Assigned implementer:** testing-engineer
**Dependencies:** Task Groups 1-2

- [ ] 3.0 Review existing tests and add critical integration tests
  - [ ] 3.1 Review tests from Task Groups 1-2
    - Review the 2-8 tests written by api-engineer (Task 1.1)
    - Review the 2-8 tests written by ui-designer (Task 2.1)
    - Total existing tests: approximately 4-16 tests
  - [ ] 3.2 Analyze test coverage gaps for portfolio benchmarking feature
    - Identify critical user workflows that lack test coverage
    - Focus ONLY on gaps related to portfolio benchmarking requirements
    - Prioritize end-to-end workflows over unit test gaps
    - Key workflows to assess:
      - Complete user flow: upload portfolio → set parameters → view results
      - Portfolio with missing ticker data handling
      - Invalid date range handling
      - Invalid JSON file handling
  - [ ] 3.3 Write up to 10 additional strategic tests maximum
    - Add maximum of 10 new tests to fill identified critical gaps
    - Focus on integration points and end-to-end workflows:
      - Integration test: API endpoint with real yfinance data (if feasible)
      - Integration test: Frontend form submission to API
      - End-to-end test: Complete benchmark workflow with sample portfolio
      - Error scenario tests: Invalid portfolio JSON, missing tickers, invalid dates
    - Do NOT write comprehensive coverage for all scenarios
    - Skip edge cases unless business-critical
  - [ ] 3.4 Run feature-specific tests only
    - Run ONLY tests related to portfolio benchmarking feature (tests from 1.1, 2.1, and 3.3)
    - Expected total: approximately 14-26 tests maximum
    - Do NOT run the entire application test suite
    - Verify all critical workflows pass
    - Document any test failures and required fixes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All feature-specific tests pass (approximately 14-26 tests total)
- Critical user workflows for portfolio benchmarking are covered
- No more than 10 additional tests added by testing-engineer
- End-to-end workflow (upload → submit → results) is tested
- Error handling paths are verified
- Testing focused exclusively on portfolio benchmarking feature

## Understand the context

Read @agent-os/specs/2026-01-01-portfolio-benchmarking-time-window/spec.md to understand the context for this spec and where the current task fits into it.

## Perform the implementation

Implement all tasks assigned to you in your task group.

Focus ONLY on implementing the areas that align with **areas of specialization** (your "areas of specialization" are defined above).

Guide your implementation using:
- **The existing patterns** that you've found and analyzed.
- **User Standards & Preferences** which are defined below.

Self-verify and test your work by:
- Running ONLY the tests you've written (if any) and ensuring those tests pass.
- IF your task involves user-facing UI, and IF you have access to browser testing tools, open a browser and use the feature you've implemented as if you are a user to ensure a user can use the feature in the intended way.


## Update tasks.md task status

In the current spec's `tasks.md` find YOUR task group that's been assigned to YOU and update this task group's parent task and sub-task(s) checked statuses to complete for the specific task(s) that you've implemented.

Mark your task group's parent task and sub-task as complete by changing its checkbox to `- [x]`.

DO NOT update task checkboxes for other task groups that were NOT assigned to you for implementation.


## Document your implementation

Using the task number and task title that's been assigned to you, create a file in the current spec's `implementation` folder called `[task-number]-[task-title]-implementation.md`.

For example, if you've been assigned implement the 3rd task from `tasks.md` and that task's title is "Commenting System", then you must create the file: `agent-os/specs/2026-01-01-portfolio-benchmarking-time-window/implementation/3-commenting-system-implementation.md`.

Use the following structure for the content of your implementation documentation:
