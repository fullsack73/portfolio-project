## Completed: ML Forecasting and Data Pipeline Hardening
- [x] **ML Forecasting as Default:** Enabled Prophet-based ML forecasting as the default and only method for portfolio optimization, removing the frontend toggle and simplifying the API.
- [x] **Robust Data Pipeline:** Implemented a resilient data fetching and processing pipeline with several key enhancements:
    - **Ticker Sanitization:** Automatically corrects `yfinance` ticker symbols (e.g., `BRK.B` to `BRK-B`).
    - **Intelligent Data Filling:** Uses forward-fill (`ffill`) and backward-fill (`bfill`) to handle missing data from non-overlapping trading days, preventing covariance matrix errors.
    - **Graceful Failure Handling:** The application now correctly handles ticker download failures and empty datasets (e.g., for the S&P 500), preventing crashes.
- [x] **Critical Bug Fixes:** Resolved several critical bugs that caused application instability:
    - **Data Alignment Error:** Synchronized tickers between the expected returns and covariance matrix, fixing the `ValueError`.
    - **Prophet `Length Mismatch` Error:** Standardized the DataFrame structure before passing it to Prophet, preventing data processing crashes.
    - **`NameError` Hotfix:** Restored a missing `NullHandler` import.
- [x] **Log Suppression:** Silenced verbose logs from third-party libraries (`yfinance`, `cmdstanpy`) to ensure clean and readable application logs.
- [x] **Comprehensive Documentation:** Updated `DESIGN.md` and `REQUIREMENTS.md` to reflect all architectural changes, bug fixes, and new features.

## Fixing Portfolio Optimization being still broken
- [ ] **Backend:**
    - [x] **Disabling Log Suppression Temporarily:** De-Silencing logs for yfinance and/or cmdstanpy to identify the root cause of the issue.
    - [x] **Investigate and Fix:** Investigate the root cause of the issue and fix it.
        - **Root Cause Identified:** The "Length mismatch" errors in Prophet forecasting are caused by inconsistent DataFrame structure when calling `reset_index()` and assigning column names. The issue occurs because:
            - When a DataFrame index has no name, `reset_index()` creates different column structures
            - The subsequent `df_prophet.columns = ['ds', 'y']` assignment fails when the actual number of columns doesn't match the expected 2 columns
            - Different tickers show different expected axis lengths (3, 4) vs actual (2), indicating varying DataFrame structures
        - **Fix Implemented:** Replaced the problematic `reset_index()` approach with a robust DataFrame preparation method that:
            - Creates a clean DataFrame with explicit column structure using `pd.DataFrame({'ds': index, 'y': values})`
            - Completely avoids the `reset_index()` call that was causing inconsistent column structures
            - Ensures Prophet always receives exactly 2 columns (`ds` and `y`) regardless of the original DataFrame state
            - Includes proper date formatting with `pd.to_datetime()` for the Prophet model
        - **New Issue Identified:** During S&P 500 optimization, majority of tickers are being skipped during forecasting process
            - **Root Cause Analysis:** Most tickers are likely failing Prophet forecasting due to:
                - Insufficient historical data (less than 2 data points)
                - Prophet model fitting failures (convergence issues, data quality)
                - Silent failures that result in fallback return of 0, effectively removing tickers from optimization
            - **Fix Implemented:** Enhanced forecasting system with robust fallback strategies:
                - Added detailed logging to identify why specific tickers are being skipped (data points, missing values)
                - Implemented historical mean fallback when Prophet fails or data quality is poor
                - Added data quality checks (missing values > 50% threshold)
                - Prophet model tuned with reduced seasonality for better stability
                - Default to 5% return instead of 0% to ensure tickers remain in optimization
                - Multi-level error handling to catch and gracefully handle various failure modes
        - **New Issue Discovered:** Diagnostic logging does not reveal the actual reason for ticker skipping
            - **Problem:** Despite enhanced logging and fallback mechanisms, S&P 500 optimization still shows many tickers being skipped without clear explanation in logs
            - **Investigation Needed:** 
                - Check if the issue is in data fetching stage (before forecasting)
                - Verify if tickers are being filtered out during data cleaning (`dropna` operations)
                - Examine if the issue is in the alignment step between forecasts and historical data
                - Investigate if there's a silent failure mode not being caught by current logging
            - **Investigation Results:** Comprehensive logging revealed the issue is limited to specific edge cases:
                - Only 2 tickers (`BRK.B`, `BF.B`) are being dropped during data cleaning stage
                - These tickers are properly sanitized (`BRK.B` → `BRK-B`, `BF.B` → `BF-B`) but still return all NaN data
                - The vast majority of S&P 500 tickers are successfully processed through the entire pipeline
                - The "widespread skipping" issue was likely resolved by previous fixes
            - **Fix Implemented:** Enhanced sanitize_tickers function with special case handling for problematic symbols
            - **Status:** Issue largely resolved - only 2 out of ~500 S&P 500 tickers affected (99.6% success rate)
            - **Remaining:** Minor edge cases for specific tickers that may be delisted or have data issues
    - [x] **Re-enable Log Suppression:** Re-enable log suppression after the issue has been fixed.
    - [x] **Comprehensive Documentation:** Update `DESIGN.md` and `REQUIREMENTS.md` to reflect all architectural changes, bug fixes, and new features.

## Making Portfolio Optimization "Faster"

### Performance Analysis - Identified Bottlenecks:
1. **Sequential Prophet Model Training**: Each ticker trains a separate Prophet model sequentially (500+ models for S&P 500)
2. **Individual yfinance API Calls**: Each ticker fetched individually with network latency
3. **Redundant Data Processing**: Multiple DataFrame operations per ticker
4. **Prophet Model Overhead**: Full MCMC sampling for each ticker (overkill for portfolio optimization)
5. **No Caching**: Repeated computations for same tickers/date ranges

### Optimization Strategies:
- [x] **Strategy 1: Parallel Processing**
    - [x] Implement concurrent Prophet model training using ThreadPoolExecutor
    - [x] Parallelize yfinance data fetching for multiple tickers
    - [x] Add progress indicators for long-running operations
- [x] **Strategy 2: Batch Data Fetching**
    - [x] Use yfinance batch download for multiple tickers in single API call
    - [x] Implement intelligent batching based on ticker count
- [x] **Strategy 3: Lightweight Forecasting**
    - [x] Replace Prophet with faster time series models for bulk processing
    - [x] Implement simple ARIMA or exponential smoothing as faster alternative
    - [x] Use Prophet only for high-priority/individual ticker analysis

- [ ] **Strategy 4: Smart Caching System**
    - [ ] Cache historical data downloads by ticker and date range
    - [ ] Cache Prophet model forecasts with TTL (time-to-live)
    - [ ] Implement Redis or in-memory caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] **Strategy 5: Algorithmic Optimizations**
    - [ ] Pre-filter tickers based on data quality before expensive forecasting

### 🚀 **FULL TIME EFFICIENCY MODE** (Memory/Space Justified)

**Philosophy**: Prioritize maximum speed over memory/storage constraints. For financial data processing, sub-second response times are critical for user experience and trading decisions.

#### **Strategy 6: Aggressive Multi-Level Caching** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] **L1 Cache (In-Memory)**: 
    - [x] LRU cache for raw stock data (configurable size: 1-10GB)
    - [x] Forecast result cache with smart invalidation
    - [x] Function-level caching with TTL support
    - [x] Memory pressure management and automatic cleanup
- [x] **L2 Cache (Redis/Disk)**:
    - [x] Persistent cache for historical data (survives app restarts)
    - [x] Compressed storage using pickle/gzip for large DataFrames
    - [x] Background cache warming for popular tickers
    - [x] Fallback to disk storage when Redis unavailable
- [ ] **L3 Cache (Database)**: *Deferred to Phase 2*
    - [ ] SQLite/PostgreSQL for long-term historical data storage
    - [ ] Pre-aggregated daily/weekly/monthly summaries
    - [ ] Indexed queries for ultra-fast data retrieval

**📋 Caching Architecture Summary:**
- **L1 Cache**: In-memory LRU (5GB default, 15-30min TTL) for hot data
- **L2 Cache**: Redis/Disk persistent (4+ hour TTL) with gzip compression
- **Cache Warming**: Background system pre-loads FAANG, S&P 500 components
- **Smart Invalidation**: Time-based + market-hours aware TTL management
- **Fallback Strategy**: Redis → Disk → Memory-only graceful degradation
- **Files**: `cache_manager.py`, `cache_warmer.py`, `cache_init.py`

#### **Strategy 7: Memory-Intensive Pre-Processing**
- [ ] **Data Pre-Loading**:
    - [ ] Load entire S&P 500 dataset into memory at startup (2-5GB RAM)
    - [ ] Pre-compute common date ranges (1Y, 2Y, 5Y) for all major indices
    - [ ] Background refresh of data during off-peak hours
- [ ] **Model Pre-Training**:
    - [ ] Pre-train Prophet models for top 100 most-requested tickers
    - [ ] Store serialized models in memory for instant forecasting
    - [ ] Lazy loading for less common tickers

#### **Strategy 8: Ultra-Parallel Processing**
- [ ] **Multi-Processing + Multi-Threading**:
    - [ ] Use ProcessPoolExecutor for CPU-intensive Prophet training
    - [ ] ThreadPoolExecutor for I/O operations (API calls, caching)
    - [ ] Async/await for non-blocking operations
- [ ] **GPU Acceleration** (Optional):
    - [ ] Investigate CuPy/NumPy GPU acceleration for matrix operations
    - [ ] GPU-accelerated covariance calculations for large portfolios

#### **Strategy 9: Smart Data Structures**
- [ ] **Optimized DataFrames**:
    - [ ] Use categorical dtypes for tickers (memory efficient)
    - [ ] Float32 instead of Float64 where precision allows
    - [ ] Sparse matrices for large correlation/covariance calculations
- [ ] **Memory Mapping**:
    - [ ] Memory-mapped files for very large datasets
    - [ ] Zero-copy operations where possible

#### **Strategy 10: Predictive Optimization**
- [ ] **User Behavior Learning**:
    - [ ] Track most frequently requested ticker combinations
    - [ ] Pre-compute optimizations for common portfolios
    - [ ] Predictive cache warming based on usage patterns
- [ ] **Smart Prefetching**:
    - [ ] When user requests AAPL, pre-fetch related tech stocks
    - [ ] Sector-based prefetching (if user analyzes banks, prefetch all bank stocks)

#### **Strategy 11: Network & API Optimization**
- [ ] **Connection Pooling**:
    - [ ] Persistent HTTP connections to yfinance
    - [ ] Connection pooling for multiple simultaneous requests
- [ ] **Data Compression**:
    - [ ] Compress API responses and cache entries
    - [ ] Use efficient serialization (msgpack, protobuf)

#### **Performance Targets (Full Efficiency Mode)**:
- **S&P 500 Portfolio Optimization**: < 5 seconds (from current ~1 minute)
- **Individual Stock Analysis**: < 0.5 seconds
- **Cache Hit Ratio**: > 90% for repeated requests
- **Memory Usage**: 5-15GB RAM acceptable for production deployment
- **Storage**: 50-200GB disk space for comprehensive caching

#### **Implementation Priority**:
1. **Phase 1**: Strategy 6 (Aggressive Caching) - Biggest impact
2. **Phase 2**: Strategy 7 (Memory-Intensive Pre-Processing) - User experience
3. **Phase 3**: Strategy 8 (Ultra-Parallel) - Technical optimization
4. **Phase 4**: Strategy 9-11 (Advanced optimizations) - Fine-tuning

**Expected Result**: Transform from a "batch processing" tool to a "real-time" financial analysis platform suitable for professional trading environments.

### 🔧 **Active Debugging Tasks**
- [x] **Fix `get_ticker_group` NameError in portfolio optimization API** ✅ **RESOLVED**
  - **Root Cause**: Missing `from ticker_lists import get_ticker_group` in `portfolio_optimization.py`
  - **Fix Applied**: Added import statement on line 19
  - **Test Result**: API endpoint now returns successful portfolio optimization (AAPL/MSFT/GOOGL test passed)
  - **Resolution Time**: < 5 minutes
- [x] **Fix `stats` NameError in lightweight forecasting** ✅ **RESOLVED**
  - **Problem**: Lightweight forecasting functions failing with `NameError: name 'stats' is not defined`
  - **Root Cause**: Missing `linregress` import from `scipy.stats` in `portfolio_optimization.py`
  - **Fix Applied**: Added `linregress` to import and updated function call
  - **Test Result**: Lightweight forecasting now works without Prophet fallback
  - **Performance Impact**: Restored 90% lightweight + 10% Prophet hybrid forecasting
  - **Resolution Time**: < 5 minutes
- [ ] Test caching system performance with real portfolio optimization requests
- [ ] Validate cache hit ratios and memory usage under load
    - [ ] Implement early termination for obviously problematic tickers
    - [ ] Use sampling for very large portfolios (e.g., top 100 from S&P 500)

### Implementation Priority:
1. **High Impact, Low Effort**: Batch data fetching and parallel processing
2. **Medium Impact, Medium Effort**: Lightweight forecasting alternatives
3. **High Impact, High Effort**: Comprehensive caching system

### Critical Regression Issue:
- **Problem**: After implementing batch fetching, ALL tickers (503/503) are being dropped during data cleaning
- **Symptoms**: 
  - `GET_STOCK_DATA FAILED: ['LH', 'EBAY', 'ADI', 'A', 'SMCI', 'TRV', 'APA', 'ABBV', 'LMT', 'CDW']...`
  - `DROPPED DURING DATA CLEANING: 503 tickers`
- **Root Cause Identified**: Incorrect handling of yfinance MultiIndex DataFrame structure for batch downloads
  - yfinance returns MultiIndex columns: `('Close', 'AAPL')`, `('Close', 'MSFT')`, etc.
  - Original code incorrectly accessed `batch_data.columns.names` instead of `batch_data.columns.get_level_values(0)`
  - Close price extraction logic was fundamentally flawed for multi-ticker downloads
- **Fix Implemented**: 
  - Proper MultiIndex DataFrame handling with `isinstance(batch_data.columns, pd.MultiIndex)` check
  - Correct Close price extraction using `batch_data.columns.get_level_values(0)`
  - Enhanced logging to debug DataFrame structure issues
  - Robust fallback handling for edge cases
- **Priority**: CRITICAL - Portfolio optimization completely broken
- **Fix Status**: [x] COMPLETED

## App.jsx Refactoring - Unified Button Update Logic

### **Problem Statement**
Currently, the App.jsx component has three separate buttons (ticker input, date range, future prediction days) that each trigger independent data updates. This creates a poor user experience where users must click multiple buttons sequentially to see the complete effect of changing a single parameter.

### **Current Issues**
1. **Fragmented Updates**: Each button handler (`handleTickerChange`, `handleDateRangeChange`, `handleFutureDaysChange`) calls `fetchData()` independently
2. **Inconsistent State**: Users see partial updates when changing one parameter
3. **Poor UX**: Requires multiple clicks to see complete results after changing any single input
4. **Redundant API Calls**: Multiple unnecessary requests when users change multiple parameters

### **Solution Design**
- **Unified Update Logic**: Create a single `updateData()` function that always uses current state values
- **Immediate Feedback**: Any button click triggers a complete data refresh with all current parameters
- **State Synchronization**: Ensure all three parameters (ticker, date range, future days) are always used together
- **Optimized API Calls**: Reduce redundant requests through better state management

### **Implementation Tasks**
- [x] **Analyze Current Structure**: Document current button handlers and data flow
- [x] **Create Unified Update Function**: Replace individual `fetchData()` calls with centralized `updateData()`
- [x] **Refactor Button Handlers**: Modify handlers to update state and trigger unified update
- [x] **Remove Redundant useEffect**: Eliminate unnecessary effect dependencies that cause multiple fetches
- [x] **Test User Experience**: Verify single-click updates work for all three buttons (replaced with auto-update)
- [x] **Update Documentation**: Reflect changes in DESIGN.md and REQUIREMENTS.md

### **Root Cause Analysis - Remaining Issues**
After initial refactoring, users still need to click separate buttons because:
1. **`DateInput.jsx`** has its own "Update Chart" button that calls `handleDateChange()`
2. **`FutureDateInput.jsx`** has its own "Update Prediction" button that calls `handleClick()`
3. These components maintain internal state and only update parent on button click
4. The unified `updateData()` function in App.jsx is not automatically triggered by input changes

### **Complete Solution Strategy**
- **Option A: Auto-trigger on Input Change**
  - Remove manual buttons from DateInput and FutureDateInput components
  - Add onChange handlers that immediately call parent callback functions
  - Use debouncing to prevent excessive API calls during typing
  
- **Option B: Unified Update Button**
  - Remove individual component buttons
  - Add single "Update All" button in App.jsx that triggers complete refresh
  - Show current parameter values but require single action to apply changes

**Selected Approach: Option A** - Auto-trigger for better UX

### **Detailed Implementation Plan**
- [x] **Remove Manual Buttons**: Delete "Update Chart" and "Update Prediction" buttons from components
- [x] **Add Auto-Update Logic**: Implement onChange handlers that immediately call parent callbacks
- [x] **Add Debouncing**: Prevent excessive API calls during rapid input changes (500ms for dates, 800ms for ticker)
- [x] **Update Component Props**: Ensure parent callbacks are called with current values
- [x] **Clean Up App.jsx**: Remove unused onSubmit prop and handleSubmit function
- [ ] **Test Complete Flow**: Verify any input change triggers full data refresh

## Debug Plan - User Input Ignored Issue

### **Problem Analysis**
From terminal logs, we can see:
```
GET /get-data?ticker=AAPL&regression=true&future_days=30&start_date=2022-04-19&end_date=2025-07-19
GET /get-data?ticker=AAPL&regression=true&future_days=30&start_date=2025-04-19&end_date=2025-07-19
GET /get-data?ticker=AAPL&regression=true&future_days=30&start_date=2022-04-19&end_date=2025-07-19
```

**Issues Identified:**
1. **Multiple API Calls**: 3 calls in quick succession suggest race conditions
2. **Inconsistent Date Ranges**: Different start dates (2022 vs 2025) indicate state synchronization issues
3. **Default Values**: App appears to revert to default values instead of using user input
4. **Future End Date**: End date shows 2025-07-19 (future date) suggesting initialization issues

### **Root Cause Hypotheses**
1. **State Race Conditions**: Debounced updates may be interfering with each other
2. **useEffect Dependencies**: Initial data fetch useEffect may be overriding user changes
3. **State Update Timing**: setTimeout in handlers may not be working correctly with React state batching
4. **Component Re-initialization**: Components may be resetting to default values
5. **API URL Construction**: updateData() may be using stale state values

### **Debug Steps**
- [x] **Add Console Logging**: Add detailed logging to track state changes and API calls
- [x] **Check useEffect Dependencies**: Verified initial data fetch was overriding user input - FIXED
- [x] **Test State Propagation**: Added logging to track parent state updates from child components
- [x] **Debug Debouncing Logic**: Added logging to track debounced function calls
- [x] **Verify API Call Parameters**: Added logging to show API URLs being constructed
- [x] **Fix Race Conditions**: Implemented initialization flag to prevent multiple initial calls
- [ ] **Test User Input Flow**: Ready to verify each input type works independently

### **Key Fixes Implemented**
1. **Race Condition Fix**: Added `isInitialized` flag to prevent useEffect from triggering multiple times
2. **DateInput Initialization**: Added `isInitialSetup` flag to prevent callback on component mount
3. **Comprehensive Logging**: Added detailed console logs to track the complete data flow
4. **Source Tracking**: Each API call now shows which component/action triggered it

## Ticker Input Synchronization Issue

### **Problem Analysis**
From latest terminal logs:
```
GET /get-data?ticker=AAPL&regression=true&future_days=30&start_date=2025-04-19&end_date=2025-07-19
GET /get-data?ticker=MSFT&regression=true&future_days=30&start_date=2025-04-19&end_date=2025-07-19
```

**Issues Identified:**
1. **Dual API Calls**: Both AAPL and MSFT calls are made when user changes ticker to MSFT
2. **State Lag**: Suggests the old ticker state is still being used in one call
3. **Race Condition**: Multiple updateData() calls happening simultaneously

### **Root Cause Hypotheses**
1. **TickerInput Debouncing**: 800ms delay may allow multiple state updates
2. **State Closure**: updateData() may be capturing stale ticker state
3. **Multiple Triggers**: Both initialization and user input triggering API calls
4. **React State Batching**: State updates not being batched correctly

### **Debug & Fix Plan**
- [x] **Check Console Logs**: Examine browser console for debug output from our logging
- [x] **Analyze State Timing**: Verified timing issues between state updates and API calls
- [x] **Fix State Closure**: updateData() confirmed to use current state, not captured state
- [x] **Optimize Debouncing**: Reduced TickerInput debounce from 800ms to 300ms
- [x] **Add Call Cancellation**: Implemented AbortController to cancel previous API calls
- [ ] **Test Ticker Changes**: Ready to verify only intended ticker is used in API calls

### **Ticker Synchronization Fixes Implemented**
1. **API Call Cancellation**: Added AbortController to cancel previous requests when new ones are made
2. **Request Deduplication**: Only the most recent API call will complete, preventing dual ticker calls
3. **Improved Debouncing**: Reduced ticker input delay from 800ms to 300ms for better responsiveness
4. **Cleanup Handling**: Added useEffect cleanup to cancel pending calls on component unmount
5. **Enhanced Logging**: Added cancellation logging to track when requests are aborted

### **Expected Benefits**
1. **Improved UX**: Single click on any button shows complete updated results
2. **Consistent State**: All charts and data always reflect current parameter values
3. **Reduced API Calls**: Eliminate redundant requests from sequential button clicks
4. **Cleaner Code**: Centralized data fetching logic, easier to maintain

### Additional issues identified
1. **Redundant API Calls**: Calling same API multiple times when there is no change in parameters
