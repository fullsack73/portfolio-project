# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to significantly improve the performance of portfolio optimization by implementing batch/group-based ML forecasting instead of processing tickers individually. The current system processes each ticker sequentially or in parallel but still treats each ticker as an independent forecasting task. By leveraging batch processing and shared feature learning across related tickers, we can achieve substantial speed improvements while potentially improving forecast accuracy through cross-ticker relationships and market dynamics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a portfolio optimization user, I want faster forecast generation for large portfolios, so that I can analyze more investment opportunities in less time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes a portfolio with 10+ tickers THEN the total forecasting time SHALL be reduced by at least 70% compared to individual ticker processing
2. WHEN batch forecasting is enabled THEN the system SHALL maintain forecast accuracy within 5% of individual ticker forecasting performance
3. WHEN processing ticker batches THEN memory usage SHALL scale efficiently to handle the entire portfolio as a single batch when possible
4. IF batch processing fails for any reason THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to individual ticker processing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want intelligent ticker grouping for batch processing, so that related stocks can benefit from shared feature learning and market correlation patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tickers are grouped for batch processing THEN the system SHALL automatically group tickers by sector, market cap, or correlation patterns
2. WHEN creating ticker groups THEN the system SHALL prioritize processing the entire portfolio as a single batch, only splitting when memory or computational constraints require it
3. WHEN grouping fails or produces suboptimal groups THEN the system SHALL fall back to random grouping or individual processing
4. IF ticker metadata is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use correlation-based grouping as a fallback

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a batch-aware ML forecasting architecture, so that models can leverage cross-ticker relationships and shared market features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training batch models THEN the system SHALL support multi-output regression for simultaneous ticker prediction
2. WHEN using ensemble methods THEN the system SHALL train shared base models across ticker groups
3. WHEN processing batches THEN the system SHALL extract common market features (VIX, sector indices, economic indicators) once per batch
4. IF individual ticker data quality is poor THEN the system SHALL leverage group patterns to improve individual predictions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious user, I want configurable batch processing options, so that I can optimize the system for my specific use case and hardware constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring batch processing THEN users SHALL be able to set maximum batch sizes with a default of processing all tickers together
2. WHEN enabling batch mode THEN users SHALL be able to choose between speed-optimized and accuracy-optimized configurations
3. WHEN system resources are limited THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust batch sizes to prevent memory overflow
4. IF batch processing is disabled THEN the system SHALL seamlessly revert to the current individual processing approach

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want visibility into batch processing performance, so that I can monitor and optimize the forecasting pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN batch processing completes THEN the system SHALL log batch size, processing time, and accuracy metrics
2. WHEN comparing batch vs individual performance THEN the system SHALL provide detailed performance reports
3. WHEN batch processing encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log specific failure reasons and fallback actions taken
4. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for optimization, including whether to use single-batch or split-batch processing
